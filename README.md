# Set-Up Software On Your Computer

Your _development environment_ is the hardware and software you use to write
code.  As a developer, it is usually your responsibility to set up your
environment based on the work you will be doing at your new job.  As tasks
change, you'll often need to update or reconfigure your environment for new
software, packages, or versions.

Please follow the appropriate guide (PC, Mac, or Linux) to set up your
development environment on your operating system. While there are contractually
obligated minimum requirements for hardware and operating system for the main
program, you may complete the prepwork on any computer in which you are able to
install and use the required software.

We're always here to help, but it is your responsibility to configure your
development machine.
