# Debugging Environment Issues

Your _environment_ is the sum of your development machine and all the tools and
software you have installed on it.  Almost everyone has a different combination,
which can lead to some tricky bugs for you to solve.  This is a part of the job
of a software engineer.

To make things more complicated, the tools used by developers are built and
managed by hundreds of independent groups who are working regularly to make
improvements and upgrades.  For you, this means that these tools are almost
always getting better, but they'll also change, causing instructions and guides
to stop working.

One of the most important skills you'll need to practice as a developer, is
navigating these changes and figuring out how to fix the problems that arise as
documentation, tutorials, and aides fall slightly out of date.

For example, the command to install Visual Studio Code on a Mac _used_ to be
`brew cask install visual-studio-code`.  If you use that command now, you'll get
an error message:

> Error: Unknown command: cask

The best thing to do when you get an error while doing setup is to Google it.
Most of the time, you won't be the first person to have this problem!

In this case, the first result (at time of writing) is [this discussion on
Github].

The discussion covers exactly what has happened, why it's happened, and how to
fix it.

Because web development is constantly changing, documentation is always falling
out of date.  Luckily, the community is very collaborative, and you can almost
always find a fix with a bit of searching.

If you've tried searching and testing fixes and you're still stuck, ask a
Prepwork mentor or an instructor for help!
